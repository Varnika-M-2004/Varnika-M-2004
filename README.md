# Hi, I'm Varnika

I'm a recent BTech graduate in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, passionate about building practical solutions with Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP.

I’ve worked on a variety of projects including medical image classification, disease similarity analysis, generative AI tools, and chatbot development — many of which are deployed as interactive apps.

Currently, I'm looking for roles in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Applied AI where I can contribute to real-world problem solving with clean code, strong models, and a product-driven mindset.
